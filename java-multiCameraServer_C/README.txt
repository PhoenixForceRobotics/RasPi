Today marks the day that we were able to get things to the network table throught this file


To do this in the future, visit the 2019 Phoenix Force robotics wiki under the networking section

1. the code there has to be input in two different places, one in the ln250 region and one in the ln 227 region
*this can be found on the wiki
*if you encounter an error, copy this line of code to the bottom of the WPI imports:import edu.wpi.first.networktables.NetworkTable;

2. build the code, to build it

	A. check that all of the libraries have been put into the right file in file explore/finder
	B. open a new terminal
	C. set the terminal to the right place by typing CD C;\(file path here)
	D. type .\gradlew build into the terminal--IT SHOULD BUILD
	**This all assumes v.2 of the image and VSCODE
	**May only work on a WINDOWS OS machine
